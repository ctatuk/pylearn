    Condition
    Given an odd number n. Create a two-dimensional array of n Ã— n elements,
    filling it with characters "." (each element of the array is a string of one character).
    Then fill in with the characters "*" the middle row of the array, the middle column of the array,
    the main diagonal and the side diagonal. As a result, units in the array should form an asterisk image.
    Display the resulting array on the screen, separating the elements of the array with spaces.
