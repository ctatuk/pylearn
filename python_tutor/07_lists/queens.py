    Condition
    It is known that 8 queens can be placed on an 8 Ã— 8 board so that they do not beat each other.
    You have been given the arrangement of 8 queens on the board,
    determine if there is a pair of beating each other among them.
    The program receives eight pairs of numbers as an input,
    each number from 1 to 8 - coordinates of 8 queens. If the queens do not beat each other,
    print the word NO, otherwise print YES.
